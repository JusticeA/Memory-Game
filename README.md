# Playing with JavaScript, Sass and HTML

This is my version of a Memory Game developed using pure HTML, Sass and JavaScript.

I have been off for a while, so I am just testing to see if I still got it.

### Note:

 This program doesn't follow certain JavaScript best practices as such. I am fully aware of certain corrections to be made and I plan on making them with further commits. I also welcome feedbacks, as I believe this will help me improve and become a better developer.
